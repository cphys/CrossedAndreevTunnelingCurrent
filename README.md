# Calculations associated with Tunneling Current Measurement Scheme to Detect Majorana Zero Mode Induced Crossed Andreev Reflection

This code follows calculations in [Tunneling Current Measurement Scheme to Detect Majorana Zero Mode Induced Crossed Andreev Reflection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.11177.pdf) paper by Fang et al.

## Instructions
* Run the mathematica code to verify the calculations i the code.

## To Do
* Documentation needs to improved within this code.
* Add file to recreate the plots.
